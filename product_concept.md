# Product Concept: The Pre-Flight Checklist

> **The Mission:** "Get you to the car. On time. Every time."
> **The Result:** Peace of mind comes from reliability, not relaxation.

## 1. The Core Philosophy
This is a **Professional Time Utility**.
*   **The Reality:** Every second matters.
*   **The Approach:** Sincere, precise, and authoritative.
*   **The Handoff:** The moment the "Departure" alarm sounds, you are in the car. We hand off to **Apple Maps**.

## 2. The Mechanics (Reverse-Engineered Time)
We deal in hard constraints.

1.  **The Anchor:** "Meeting at [7:00 PM]." (Hard Stop).
2.  **The Variable:** [Apple Maps] calculates traffic is exactly 15 minutes.
3.  **The Prep:** You allocate [20 minutes] for preparation.
4.  **The Calculation:** 
    *   **Start Time:** 6:25 PM.
    *   **Departure Time:** 6:45 PM.

## 3. The "Fail-Safe" Defense (Barrage Mode)
You used to set 30 alarms. We automate that.
*   **The Problem:** "I need to wake up. Period."
*   **The Solution:** **Barrage Mode (Auto-Snooze Loop).**
    *   **Behavior:** Once the Start Time hits, the alarm activates.
    *   **The Loop:** If you silence it, it **automatically re-arms** for 60 seconds later. And again. And again.
    *   **The Exit:** It only stops when you perform the **"Master Dismiss"** (e.g., a "I'm Awake" long-press or slider).
    *   **No Gimmicks:** No barcodes. No math. Just a relentless, pounding reminder that *keeps coming* until you confirm you are up.

## 4. The "Active" Experience
Between "Start Time" and "Departure Time," the app provides critical status checks.
*   **T-Minus 20m (Start):** Alarm fires (Barrage Mode active).
*   **T-Minus 10m (Status Check):** Notification. "10 minutes remaining."
*   **T-Minus 5m (Final Check):** "items in hand. Shoes on."
*   **T-Minus 0m (Execute):** "Departure Time." -> **Tap to Open Apple Maps.**

## 5. The Intelligence
*   **Live Traffic:** We monitor conditions. If the drive time increases, the Departure Time shifts earlier. We alert you immediately.
*   **The Promise:** If you respect the countdown, you will arrive on time.
